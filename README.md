Project Description:
In this project we want to learn to play as a better core player in DOTA. DOTA is a 5v5 Online Multiplayer Battle Arena where players battle it out to destroy each others ancients. Core players in DOTA farm creeps and get gold and exp to buy items and improve their heroes abilities. this results in them being stronger in fights and eventually win the game. With data that we acquired from Opendota, we plan to build a model that predicts the rank of core players, and in doing so, find out what metrics we need to improve on
